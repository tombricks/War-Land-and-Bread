 war_justification.10.d: "'It is with heavy heart that we must confront the reality of our situation: An invasion of [From.GetName] may be our only recourse. It is of too great a strategic advantage to attempt any other solution in our current situation. Although we trust that neither the [Root.GetAdjective] nor the [From.GetAdjective] people want war, but history has led us to this point and our options are limited. We can only hope that through this assertion of our military power, we can avoid further bloodshed in the future.'\n\nAlthough it is a popular theory that democracies do not go to war against other democracies, recent developments have pointed to a [Root.GetAdjective] invasion of [From.GetName] in the future.

Relentless and ruthless, it threatens to devour not only the [From.GetAdjective] people's hope of a prosperous, democratic society, but that of its neighbors as well. If we do not act now, we may well see this first domino fall too late, leaving more failed social experiments in its wake. How many more need die before we intervene?'\n\nThe threat of subversive activity undermining our democracy, fueled by [From.GetAdjective] ambitions, has become a hotly debated topic recently. While representatives in opposition have called this a Red Scare aimed at pursuing war with [From.GetName], the rhetoric of the [Root.GetRulingParty] has been highly successful so far."

 war_justification.12.d: "'In modern history, perhaps even in history as a whole, there has been no worse tyranny than the iron grip in which [From.GetRulingParty] now holds [From.GetName]. People may argue that we should not provoke conflict, that we should trust [From.GetLeader] to honor treaties and promises in the future, but these people fail to see that treaties made under the reign of fascism are useless. To these dishonorable liars, might makes right, and the paper on which an agreement is written burns just as easily as the books of their detractors.'\n\nPeople who have long hoped to avoid a direct confrontation with [From.GetName] have now been strongly opposed by [Root.GetLeader], who argues that we in Machiavellian terms are merely postponing war to the advantage of the enemy. At this rate, we may strike the first blow after all."
 war_justification.12.a: "There can be no peace in our time until they are gone."
 war_justification.13.t: "[Root.GetLeader] Calls for War Against [From.GetName]"
 war_justification.13.d: "'Although we may be a peaceful people, our nature alone does not determine the course we must take in history. This is a time of war. For too long, the [From.GetAdjective] have possessed the means that we need to make it through the trials we may face, and it's apparent that they will not part with them peacefully. Despite our best efforts to build a modern state, some matters can only be settled through the old trials of battle.'\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s hostile rhetoric towards [From.GetName] has gone to great lengths to justify an invasion. Some portion of the population support this course, but the decision lies in the lands of our leader."
 war_justification.13.a: "It may be a difficult decision, but we must stand behind it."
 war_justification.14.t: "[Root.GetLeader] Challenges [From.GetAdjective] Pretensions"
 war_justification.14.d: "'[From.GetName] may think themselves more modern and advanced than us, but the truth is that their nation has not been tested as ours has, nor are they prepared for the threats now plain to see on the horizon. By their disdain towards us, and preventing us to seize that which is rightfully ours, they have made us one of those threats to themselves. Their weak and divided nation will hardly resist our claims.'\n\nThe derisive opinion of [From.GetName] long held by the [Root.GetRulingParty] has developed from criticism to hostility. Although popular opinion is that the [From.GetAdjective] people want to avoid war, [Root.GetLeader] claims that their elected leaders have provoked it through their arrogance."
 war_justification.14.a: "They do not know how strong our hardships have made us."
 war_justification.15.t: "[Root.GetLeader] Wants to Restore Order in [From.GetName]"
 war_justification.15.d: "'The [Root.GetAdjective] national spirit is strong, but not all nations are so fortunate. [From.GetName] has had its traditions destroyed and rightful rulers long since murdered and buried, all in the name of the idea of the great Marxist revolution. It is our duty to restore order to this world led astray by bloodthirsty usurpers and to assert the strength of [Root.GetName] against this threat.'\n\nWhile the [Root.GetRulingParty] has always opposed communism, [From.GetName] has been a target of particular attacks in recent speeches. Whether or not the attack on the [Root.GetAdjective] nation from communists is a real threat, the preemptive attack on [From.GetAdjective] communism is already in the works."
 war_justification.15.a: "Those murdered in the revolution will be avenged!"

 war_justification.16.d: "'My opponents would have you believe that my rule is like that of the [From.GetRulingParty] in [From.GetName]. They could not be more wrong. While [From.GetLeader]'s successes are the result of a recent fad, a destructive mass movement bent on bullying other nations into submission, the [Root.GetRulingParty] stands in opposition to that movement as the ones who will not submit. I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to eliminate this threat, even if it means war.'\n\nThe [Root.GetLeader] regime has adopted a hostile policy towards the [From.GetAdjective] nation. Whatever our leaders may be called, fascist is a word reserved for our enemies."

The strategic importance of this border cannot be overstated, and we are well within our rights to shift it to ensure the continued security of our people.'\n\nListening to [Root.GetLeader]'s recent speeches, an invasion of [From.GetName] appears imminent. Dissenting voices have objected, but public support for war is on the rise."

 war_justification.18.t: "[Root.GetLeader] Questions the Motives of [From.GetName]"
 war_justification.18.d: "'There is no doubt that [From.GetName] is preparing for war.

Will we stand idly by and watch them arm themselves while [Root.GetName] is undefended? Or will we disarm this threat before it grows beyond our power?'\n\nThe hawks in the [Root.GetRulingParty] have turned their eyes towards [From.GetName], arguing that attack is the best defense. Their viewpoint is gaining traction and [Root.GetName] is preparing for war."

 war_justification.19.d: "'Those naïve citizens of [Root.GetName] who imagine the [From.GetAdjective] as a people of peace are entirely out of touch with reality. Those who live at our border do not have the luxury of such delusions, seeing their troops closing in on us just across it. This is a threat we cannot leave unanswered. With every passing day, [From.GetName] is preparing for war. It would be madness for us not to do the same.'\n\nThe [From.GetAdjective] military presence close to our territory has sparked increased concern as this nation appears more and more to be the enemy of the [Root.GetRulingParty]. Whether it is the cause or the effect of their polemic is a matter of contention."

It's time to act.'\n\nA series of rousing speeches from [Root.GetRulingParty] leaders, most prominently [Root.GetLeader], has been calling the public to support an invasion of [From.GetName]. The geopolitical motives behind the invasion are less prominent in the rhetoric to patriotic sentiments, but this campaign appears highly efficient in convincing the public of its necessity."

Barring a complete turnaround in the policies of [Root.GetAdjective] leadership, we will be left with no recourse but to fight.'\n\n[From.GetAdjective] intervention in our domestic affairs has been a hot issue, with some politicians in their opposition claiming that [From.GetRulingParty] has pursued a hawkish policy from the start. Whatever their original intent, a future war now suddenly seems very real and inevitable."
 war_justification.209.a: "Their condescending rhetoric will not intimidate us."
 war_justification.210.t: "[From.GetLeader] Calls for Intervention in [Root.GetName]"
 war_justification.210.d: "'It is with heavy heart that we must confront the reality of our situation: An invasion of [Root.GetName] may be our only recourse. It is of too great a strategic advantage to attempt any other solution in our current situation. Although we trust that neither the [From.GetAdjective] nor the [Root.GetAdjective] people want war, but history has led us to this point and our options are limited. We can only hope that through this assertion of our military power, we can avoid further bloodshed in the future.'\n\nAlthough it is a popular theory that democracies do not go to war against other democracies, recent developments have pointed to a [From.GetAdjective] invasion of [Root.GetName] in the future. History may surprise us yet."
 war_justification.210.a: "[From.GetName] is a dubious democracy anyway, pursuing such aggressive action."
 war_justification.211.t: "[From.GetLeader] Speaks Against Red Menace"
 war_justification.211.d: "'Without a doubt, [Root.GetName] communism is one of the greatest threats to liberty and order in this era. Relentless and ruthless, it threatens to devour not only the [Root.GetAdjective] people's hope of a prosperous, democratic society, but that of its neighbors as well. If we do not act now, we may well see this first domino fall too late, leaving more failed social experiments in its wake. How many more need die before we intervene?'\n\nThe nascent worker's movement has intimidated [From.GetAdjective] leaders. While representatives in their opposition have called this a Red Scare aimed at pursuing war with us, the rhetoric of the [From.GetRulingParty] has been highly successful so far."
 war_justification.211.a: "As long as there is profit to be made, capitalists will manufacture a war."
 war_justification.212.t: "[From.GetLeader] Confronts [Root.GetAdjective] Fascism"
 war_justification.212.d: "'In modern history, perhaps even in history as a whole, there has been no worse tyranny than the iron grip in which [Root.GetRulingParty] now holds [Root.GetName]. People may argue that we should not provoke conflict, that we should trust [Root.GetLeader] to honor treaties and promises in the future, but these people fail to see that treaties made under the reign of fascism are useless. To these dishonorable liars, might makes right, and the paper on which an agreement is written burns just as easily as the books of their detractors.'\n\nJealous of the glorious society we are building and the legacy it is founded upon, the [From.GetAdjective] seem prepared to start a war to destroy it. So much for their pretensions of peace."
 war_justification.212.a: "Inevitable. Better to have it over with."
 war_justification.213.t: "[From.GetLeader] Calls for War Against [Root.GetName]"
 war_justification.213.d: "'Although we may be a peaceful people, our nature alone does not determine the course we must take in history. This is a time of war. For too long, the [Root.GetAdjective] have possessed the means that we need to make it through the trials we may face, and it's apparent that they will not part with them peacefully. Despite our best efforts to build a modern state, some matters can only be settled through the old trials of battle.'\n\nIn a recent speech to the [From.GetAdjective] people the hostile rhetoric towards [Root.GetName] has intensified and [From.GetLeader] has gone to great lengths to justify an invasion. Some portion of the population support this course, but the decision lies in the lands of their leader."
 war_justification.213.a: "They will regret making us their enemy."
 war_justification.214.t: "[From.GetLeader] Challenges [Root.GetAdjective] Pretensions"
 war_justification.214.d: "'[Root.GetName] may think themselves more modern and advanced than us, but the truth is that their nation has not been tested as ours has, nor are they prepared for the threats now plain to see on the horizon. By their disdain towards us, and preventing us to seize that which is rightfully ours, they have made us one of those threats to themselves. Their weak and divided nation will hardly resist our claims.'\n\nThe derisive opinion of [Root.GetName] long held by the [From.GetRulingParty] has developed from criticism to hostility. Although popular opinion is that the [Root.GetAdjective] people want to avoid war, [From.GetLeader] claims that our elected leaders have provoked it through their arrogance."
 war_justification.214.a: "The voices for peace among the [From.GetAdjective] people are, of course, silenced."
 war_justification.215.t: "[From.GetLeader] Wants to Restore Order in [Root.GetName]"
 war_justification.215.d: "'The [From.GetAdjective] national spirit is strong, but not all nations are so fortunate. [Root.GetName] has had its traditions destroyed and rightful rulers long since murdered and buried, all in the name of the idea of the great Marxist revolution. It is our duty to restore order to this world led astray by bloodthirsty usurpers and to assert the strength of [From.GetName] against this threat.'\n\nWhile the [From.GetRulingParty] has always opposed communism, [Root.GetName] has been a target of particular attacks in recent speeches. Fearing their nation's inevitable progress to the next stage of history, a preemptive attack on [Root.GetAdjective] communism is already in the works."
 war_justification.215.a: "It's too late to reverse the progress we've made."
 war_justification.216.t: "[From.GetLeader] Calls Out [Root.GetAdjective] Oppressors"
 war_justification.216.d: "'My opponents would have you believe that my rule is like that of the [Root.GetRulingParty] in [Root.GetName]. They could not be more wrong. While [Root.GetLeader]'s successes are the result of a recent fad, a destructive mass movement bent on bullying other nations into submission, the [From.GetRulingParty] stands in opposition to that movement as the ones who will not submit. I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to eliminate this threat, even if it means war.'\n\nThe [From.GetLeader] regime has adopted a hostile policy towards the [Root.GetAdjective] nation. Our visionary plans for future greatness have put their nation to shame, and unsurprisingly, they feel threatened."
 war_justification.216.a: "If they want to test our might, they will regret it."
 war_justification.217.t: "[From.GetLeader] Questions [Root.GetAdjective] Sovereignty"
 war_justification.217.d: "'Who determines the borders of a nation and how are they determined? Whatever way people may have found in the past to justify where [From.GetName] ends and [Root.GetName] begins, we live in a new era. The strategic importance of this border cannot be overstated, and we are well within our rights to shift it to ensure the continued security of our people.'\n\nListening to [From.GetLeader]'s recent speeches, an invasion of [Root.GetName] appears imminent. Dissenting voices have objected, but public support for war is on the rise."
 war_justification.217.a: "Has the world learned nothing from the Great War?"
 war_justification.218.t: "[From.GetLeader] Questions the Motives of [Root.GetName]"
 war_justification.218.d: "'There is no doubt that [Root.GetName] is preparing for war. The changes in economic policy make it plain to see that the [Root.GetAdjective] are not a people of peace, but rather waiting for the right opportunity to strike against us. Will we stand idly by and watch them arm themselves while [From.GetName] is undefended? Or will we disarm this threat before it grows beyond our power?'\n\nThe hawks in the [From.GetRulingParty] have turned their eyes towards [Root.GetName], arguing that attack is the best defense. Their viewpoint is gaining traction and [From.GetName] is preparing for war."
 war_justification.218.a: "This is exactly why we need to be ready."
 war_justification.219.t: "[From.GetLeader] Angered by [Root.GetAdjective] Posturing"
 war_justification.219.d: "'Those naïve citizens of [From.GetName] who imagine the [Root.GetAdjective] as a people of peace are entirely out of touch with reality. Those who live at our border do not have the luxury of such delusions, seeing their troops closing in on us just across it. This is a threat we cannot leave unanswered. With every passing day, [Root.GetName] is preparing for war. It would be madness for us not to do the same.'\n\nOur military presence close to [From.GetAdjective] territory has sparked increased concern, since they interpret our troop movements as proof hostile intent. They hardly seem to have considered that their aggressive rhetoric is the reason for our defensive measures."
 war_justification.219.a: "We can hardly disarm after these threats."
 war_justification.220.t: "[From.GetLeader] Advocates Invasion of [Root.GetName]"
 war_justification.220.d: "'If we want to have the strategic advantage in the foreseeable, not to say inevitable war with [Root.GetName], there is no room to hesitate. This is about safeguarding our children's futures and ensuring that [From.GetName] has a place in the world tomorrow. This is a matter of devotion to our cause and the ideals we take for granted. It's time to act.'\n\nA series of rousing speeches from [From.GetRulingParty] leaders, most prominently [From.GetLeader], has been calling the public to support an invasion of [Root.GetName]. The geopolitical motives behind the invasion are less prominent in the rhetoric to patriotic sentiments, but this campaign appears highly efficient in convincing the public of its necessity."
 war_justification.220.a: "We better prepare. The war will come."
 war_justification.301.t: "[Root.GetLeader] Criticized for Weak Foreign Policy"
 war_justification.301.d: "'We had the chance to strike against our enemies, but the [Root.GetRulingParty] let it pass by. Not only is this yet another damning case in a string of missed opportunities to strengthen [Root.GetName]'s position internationally, it is a sign that their claim to be acting in the interest of the [Root.GetAdjective] people is mostly empty rhetoric. It is time for a change in policy.'\n\nOur failure to pursue the war many had expected has been the target of scathing criticism from our political opponents. Not following through on our military plans will make it more difficult for us to convince the people in which direction we're taking [Root.GetName]."
 war_justification.301.a: "Don't they want to avoid war?"
 war_justification.301.b: "There is no room for public disagreement outside of party meetings."
 war_justification.301.c: "We cannot allow people to accuse [Root.GetLeader] of cowardice!"
